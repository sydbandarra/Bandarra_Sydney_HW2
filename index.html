            <h3 class="lb_heading">Dabi</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">There are a lot of fan theories surrounding the League of Villain's competing edge lord; but if there's one thing that the fans know for a fact, it's that Dabi is one powerful guy. On his own, Dabi is one of the League's most active and essential members, as his connections and intellect have been vital to a couple of its operations.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">To really give the heroes a scare, he also his a powerful Quirk, Cremation, which allows him to summon huge bursts of blue flames. For those who didn't know, blue flames burn much hotter than a regular campfire, and they've been incredibly destructive against heroes and buildings alike.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Himiko Toga</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Toga is easily one of the most consistent members of the League, as her skills and Quirk have offered the organization plenty of use. She's a surprisingly nimble and adept combatant capable of taking on multiple U.A. students at once.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Her Quirk also makes her an exceptionally dangerous person, as it makes disguise and infiltration significantly easier. Given that she got a massive upgrade to being able to copy Quirks as well, Toga is easily one of the most dangerous players in the story.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Tomura Shigaraki</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Tomura Shigaraki's Quirk just screams villainy. With Decay, Shigaraki is able to dissolve anything that he touches and more within a few seconds. This has come to mean anything between reinforced doors and entire city blocks.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">The boy, unfortunately, had to discover it in a spectacular degree when it destroyed a dog, his entire home, and his family. Considering that he's only getting stronger and has taken an invasive procedure from Kyudai Garaki to get more powerful, Shigaraki may soon reach his master's precious throne.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Mr. Compress</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Mr. Compress oddly hasn't had a lot of agency within recent arcs, especially during the League's recent bout with the Meta Liberation Army. That lack of usefulness and screen time alone is going to cost him a lot of credit. However, what really hurts his ranking here is his near-complete lack of combat ability.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Mr. Compress' Quirk is an incredibly useful and versatile one, especially for kidnapping situations. However, it didn't do him any favors when it came to close combat; and despite his evasive nature, he was still taken down by a few hero students in their infancy.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Twice</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Twice may not look it or even act like it, but he's easily one of the most powerful members of the League and perhaps its most useful one. With his Quirk, Double, Twice is able to summon multiple clones of himself and his allies.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Not only are these clones plenty capable and sturdy within their own right, but they also carry over the Quirks of their original. Twice to this regard is essentially a one-man army who could single-handedly fight in place of the League if they ever required it.</p>

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Magne</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Magne may be long gone from the League, but her memory still lives on in some pretty decent bouts against hero and villains alike. Magne is capable of manipulating the magnetic polarity of people and objects and abuses that for her unique and devastating fighting style.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Though this inevitably didn't amount to much in the series, the power and skill still speak for themselves and her absence must still be felt within the League.</p>
